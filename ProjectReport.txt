Final Report
------------

Overall, I think the project turned out fairly well.  Many features being more complex than anticipated and the fact that many features took too long to get started, but we ended up completing everything and having a final product we were happy with.

Physics: Physics definitely took a lot of hours of coding and research to get working.  I'm happy with how it turned out, though.  I think the game plays exactly how we had imagined.
Level/Character Controls: This was fairly easy and turned out how we wanted.
Sound: Sound was also simple to implement and turned out well.
GUI: This was a last minute addition due to the lab machines not working for the first weeks, but we were able to get a simple score number to display.  We had originally planned on making pause and end game screens, but were not able to do so for time reasons.
Camera: We were really happy with the camera.  It ended up being much cooler than we expected.
