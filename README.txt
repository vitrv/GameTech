We are making good progress.  We have turned our game into pong, updated the gui, and written most of the architecture for the networking segment by linking in the NetManager wrapper.  We were unable to get a working demo, but we feel we are close enough that the concepts are visible.  We haven't made any changes to the design of our game since the initial milestone and feel that we are on track to finish before Monday.
